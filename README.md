## Introduction

Forecasting models play a crucial role in various domains, including climate science. In this project, we explore the implementation of RNNs, specifically SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), for temperature forecasting using time series data.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of the experiment, you will be able to:

- Understand and preprocess time series data
- Implement different types of Recurrent Neural Networks - SimpleRNN, LSTM, GRU
- Build and train RNNs for temperature forecasting
- Gain insights into advanced RNN concepts such as recurrent dropout, stacking recurrent layers, and Bi-directional RNNs
